# Screenshot Monitoring System

This is a **Screen Monitoring System** built using **.NET with EF Core** and **PostgreSQL/MySQL** as the database. The system consists of:

- A **desktop application** for employees that runs in the background, capturing screenshots at random intervals and tracking active/online time.
- A **web portal** for the admin to view users' screens live, track work hours, and manage employees and projects.

## Connect to Postgres DB
To connect to database create appsettings.Development.json.
Then add the Postgres Connection string to it.

```shell
cd ScreenshotMonitor.API/ 
```

```shell
cp appsettings.json appsettings.Development.json
```
Make a copy of appsettings.json

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SmDb": "CONNECTION STRING HERE" 
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "JWT": {
    "Key": "JWT KEY HERE"
  }
}
```

## **Installation & Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScreenshotMonitor.git
cd ScreenshotMonitor
```

### **2. Setup PostgreSQL/MySQL Database**
Ensure PostgreSQL or MySQL is installed and running. Create a database manually or let EF Core handle it.

#### **PostgreSQL Connection Example**
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=newDb;Username=postgres;Password=your_password;"
}
```

#### **MySQL Connection Example**
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=newDb;User=root;Password=your_password;"
}
```

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**
Create an `.env` file or set environment variables manually:
```sh
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

### **4. Apply Database Migrations**
Run the following command to create tables using EF Core:
```sh
dotnet ef database update
```

### **5. Run the Application**
To start the API server:
```sh
dotnet run
```
The server should now be running on **`http://localhost:5000`** (or a different port if configured).
